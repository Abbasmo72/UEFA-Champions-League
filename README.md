## Repository Structure 🗂️
Here’s a breakdown of what you’ll find inside:

  - EPS: European Performance Spots – the additional berths given to clubs         from the two associations with the highest coefficient points in 2024–25
    <br>

    
The label of European Performance Spots and title holders already qualified via league position are superscripted.
